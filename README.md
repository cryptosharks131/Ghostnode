# NIX
Shell script to install a [NIX Ghostnode](http://www.nixplatform.io/) on a Linux server running Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04.  
This will require a VPS, I use [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7310394).  I recommend using a $5 server.
This script will install **NIX Core 2.3.0.5**.
***

## Installation:
Log into the server using ssh (Putty for windows or terminal for Mac users) and run the following commands:
```
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cryptosharks131/Ghostnode/master/nix_install.sh
bash nix_install.sh
```
***

## Desktop wallet setup

After the GN is up and running, you need to configure the desktop wallet accordingly. Here are the steps for Windows/Mac Wallet:
1. Open the NIX Core Wallet.
2. Go to RECEIVE and create a New 'G' Address: **GN1**
3. Send **40000** **NIX** to **GN1**.
4. Wait for 15 confirmations before starting the node.
5. Go to **Help -> "Debug window - Console"**
6. Type the following command: **ghostnode outputs**
7. Open ghostnode.conf from the following folder %appdata%\nix (windows) or ~/Library/Application Support/ (hidden folder for Mac users)
8. Add the following entry:
```
Alias Address Genkey TxHash Output_index
```
* Alias: **GN1**
* Address: **VPS_IP:6214**
* Genkey: **Ghostnode GenKey**
* TxHash: **First value from Step 6** 
* Output index:  **Second value from Step 6** It can be **0** or **1**
9. Click OK and exit the Wallet.
10. Open NIX Core Wallet, go to **Ghostnode Tab**.
11. Click **Update status** to see your node. If it is not shown, close the wallet and start it again.
10. Click **Start All** or **Start Alias**
11. If you are not able to see your **Ghostnode**, try to close and open your desktop wallet.

## Usage:
```
nix-cli getblockchaininfo
nix-cli getnetworkinfo
nix-cli ghostnode status
```
Also, if you want to check/start/stop **NIX** , run one of the following commands as **root**:
```
systemctl status NIX #To check the service is running.
systemctl start NIX #To start NIX service.
systemctl stop NIX #To stop NIX service.
systemctl is-enabled NIX #To check whetether NIX service is enabled on boot or not.
```
***

## Updating NIX
The first line (rm nix_update.sh) is not required the very first time you update the node and will return an error if you run it.  This is fine, continue with the update script.
```
rm nix_update.sh*
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cryptosharks131/Ghostnode/master/nix_update.sh
bash nix_update.sh
```
***

## Cold Stake Setup
These instructions will help guide you to setting up your own cold stake on a VPS.
Log into the server using ssh (Putty for windows or terminal for Mac users) and run the following commands:
```
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cryptosharks131/Ghostnode/master/nix_cold_stake.sh
bash nix_cold_stake.sh
nix-cli encryptwallet "create_password_here"
nix-cli getnewaddress
nix-cli walletpassphrase "put_your_password_here" 0 true
```
Now you may go to your local wallet and create a LPoS contract with the following details.  
Lease To: This is the address you got from the VPS after running 'nix-cli getnewaddress'  
Amount: The amount to place in the contract (subtract fee button can be used to take the contract writing fee from this amount)  

You can now hit 'send nix' to confirm the contract and you are all set!  Once the contract gets 200 confirms, your VPS will start staking!
